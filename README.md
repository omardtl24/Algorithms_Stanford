# 📦 Stanford Algorithms Specialization – Programming Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments from the [Stanford Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) offered by Tim Roughgarden on Coursera.

The specialization consists of four rigorous courses that cover the foundations of algorithms, including:

1. **Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms**  
2. **Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures**  
3. **Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming**  
4. **Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them**

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

- 📈 Efficient solutions with focus on both correctness and performance  

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Standard libraries and numpy (For fast arrays implementation)
- Jupyter notebooks (To store and show solutions in a more organized way)

## 📚 Purpose

This repository serves both as a personal learning archive and as a helpful reference for other learners
